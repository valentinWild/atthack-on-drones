Documentation of 3D Laboratory Environment - Lab Appratus

In this Laboratory Environment, we have created all the models separatedly, all the models are reuseable and it's depends upon us that how we can use and place in the environment.
we have created Different types of Apparatus, and interior laboratory props.

Apparatus:

Analytics Lab instruments
Beaker
Boiling Liquid Stand
china Dish
Crucible and cover
Crucible Tongs
Erlenmeyer Flask
Forceps
Glass funnel
Glass Lab test tube
Graduated Cylinder
Spirit Lamp
Tap

Interior Props:

Walls
roof with light
floor
chair
2 types of shelfs
tables with drawers
Racks etc

Models are made with more than 3 textures. The 3D Laboratory Environment pack consists of different objects created individually, so you can use them to create an intuitive and eye-catching 
user interface for your 3D game or animated video. The vectors can be edited and placed at any scene in the game/video to give it a more defined look.

We have different folders:
1) Materials:
	Models are made with More than 3 textures.
2) Models: 
	All models are included in this folder
3) Prefabs: 
	All the prefabs are created in this folders
4) Scene: 
	Laboratory environment scene.
5) Texture:
	We used 3 textures in this environment.
6)Documentation: 
	Read Me File.

All the prefabs are created, you can use each prefabs according to your environment needs. you just need to drag and drop each prefab whereever you want. you can create a big Laboratory using prefabs and models for your experiment 3d games and 3d experiment animated Environment. Each objects are scable, you can transform and rotate each object.
